ELRS-2.4-GHz 2 channel CAR TX handset
This project is a rework of the ergonomic handset which can be found here.

I reworked the upper and lower cover to make it comply to the needs of a simple 2 channel CAR TX handset with EXPRESSLRS as carrier.
All switches are removed.
The original Jumper T-Lite hall gimbals are placed in a way that they can be adjusted in an angle that comforts the movement of the thumb.
Two screws accesable from the top of the trasnmitter can loosend or fastend at each gimbal in a desired angled position.
As this is a 2 channel application the left gimbal is for throttle and the right gimbal for steering.
But if you fancy it switched OPENTX or EDGETX are your friend.
For the ELRS part a DIY 2.4 GHz SX1280 with special PCB is used.

The upper and lower cover are printed in PLA.
The lower cover has 4 inserts fitted with the size of 4.2 x 5 mm for M3 to secure the upper with the lower cover with M3x16mm hexagon screws.

The battery is a single 18650 3.3 volt cell.

The original Jumper T-Lite electronics are taken from a new handset and fitted with the original screws in the upper cover.
The 4 wire cable from the gimbals to the mainboard are replaced with a longer version as the handset is wider.
