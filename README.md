This project is a rework of the ergonomic handset which can be found here.

I reworked the upper and lower cover to make it comply to the needs of a simple 2 channel CAR TX handset with EXPRESSLRS as carrier.

All switches are removed.

The original Jumper T-Lite hall gimbals are placed in a way that they can be adjusted in an angle that comforts the movement of the thumb.

Two screws accesable from the top of the trasnmitter can loosend or fastend at each gimbal to put it in a desired angled position.
There are two versions of gimbal clamps as Jumper redesigned the housing of the gimbals I found out.
"T-lite TX gimbal retainer V2" is for the gimbal versions that can not be clamped at the edges with the "T-lite TX gimbal retainer" version.

I put M3 thread in the mounting holes of the gimbals. Drill a 2.5 mm drill through them first than use a 3mm thread tapping tool with care.
The V2 version gimbal brackets are attached to the gimbal mounting holes with M3x8 mm screws.
The brackets are clamped down with a retainer that has a M3 nut pressed in, in combination with M3x20mm screws. 

As this is a 2 channel application the left gimbal is for throttle and the right gimbal for steering.
With the "T-lite TX gimbal blocker" you can block the up/down motion in the not used direction of the gimbal.

For the ELRS part a DIY 2.4 GHz SX1280 with special PCB is used. When you use a Jumper T-lite V2 ELRS version as donor transnmitter this extra board is obsolete.

The upper and lower cover are printed in PLA.
The lower cover has 4 inserts fitted with the size of 4.2 x 5 mm for M3 to secure the upper with the lower cover with M3x16mm hexagon screws.

The battery is a single 18650 3.3 volt cell.

The original Jumper T-Lite electronics are taken from a new handset and fitted with the original (4) screws in the upper cover.
The 4 wire cable from the gimbals to the mainboard might be to short in some cases and need a longer version as the handset is wider.

The receiver is a Happy Model EP2 receiver which is mounted on a DIY carrier board with a 5 volt regulator and the servo pins.
There are pins available for 2 channels (throttle and steering) and for the timing transponder if you use it for racing events.
Alternatively you can also use this receiver.
