I reworked the upper and bottom cover to make it complying to the needs of a simple 2 channel CAR TX handset.
All switches are removed.
The original Jumper T-Lite hall gimbals are placed in a way that they can be adjusted in an angle that comforts the the thumb.
Two screws accesable from the top of the trasnmitter can secure each gimbal in a desired angled position.
As this is a 2 channel application the left gimbal is for throttle and the right gimbal for steering.
For the ELRS part a DIY 2.4 GHz SX1280 with special PCB is used.

The upper and lower cover are printed in PLA.
The lower cover has 4 inserts fitted with the size 4.2 x 4 mm for M3 to secure the upper with the lower cover with M3x16mm hexagon screws.

The battery is a single 18650 3.3 volt cell.

The original Jumper T-Lite electronics are taken from an handset and fitted with the original screws in the upper cover.
The 4 wire cable from the gimbals to the mainboard are replaced with a longer version.
